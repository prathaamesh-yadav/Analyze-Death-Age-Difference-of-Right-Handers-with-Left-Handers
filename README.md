📊 Executive Summary
Project Title: Analyze Death Age Difference of Right Handers with Left Handers

Objective:
To analyze historical left-handedness rates across different ages and birth years, and investigate how these rates might influence differences in death ages between right-handed and left-handed individuals using statistical modeling and data visualization.

📈 Key Analysis and Detailed Insights:
1️⃣ Left-Handedness Rate by Age and Gender:
Visualization: Line chart comparing male and female left-handedness rates by age.

Insights:

At age 10:

Males: 13.0%

Females: 11.0%

At age 80:

Males: 2.0%

Females: 2.0%

There's a sharp decline in left-handedness with increasing age in both genders, reflecting how older generations reported or suppressed left-handedness due to societal norms.

2️⃣ Mean Left-Handedness Rate by Birth Year:
Calculation: Added a Birth_year column (1986 - Age) and calculated average left-handedness.

Visualization: Line graph of mean left-handedness (%) by birth year.

Insights:

Early 1900s (Birth years 1906–1916):
Average left-handedness: ~3.5%

Mid-1900s (Birth years 1936–1946):
Average left-handedness: ~6.0%

Late 1900s (Birth years 1976–1986):
Average left-handedness: ~11.8%

Clear upward trend over decades, reflecting societal acceptance and changing attitudes.

3️⃣ Probability of Left-Handedness by Age at Death:
A function estimated the probability of a person being left-handed based on their age of death and historical rates.

Example:
Probability of being left-handed at death:

At 20 years: 12.5%

At 40 years: 8.0%

At 80 years: 2.0%

4️⃣ Death Distribution in the United States (1999):
Visualization: Line graph of number of deaths by age.

Peak deaths occurred between 75 to 85 years.

5️⃣ Overall Probability of Being Left-Handed at Death (1990 study year):
Calculated Value: 6.36%
Meaning 6 out of every 100 people who died in 1990 would likely have been left-handed based on historical rates.

6️⃣ Death Age Probability Distribution by Handedness:
Bayesian probability distributions calculated for death ages given left or right-handedness.

7️⃣ Average Age at Death (1990 study year):
Left-Handed: 70.2 years

Right-Handed: 75.4 years

Difference: 5.2 years

Left-handed individuals historically had a 5.2-year lower average lifespan.

8️⃣ Modern Update (2018 study year):
Left-Handed: 76.6 years

Right-Handed: 77.5 years

Difference: 0.9 years

Significant reduction in lifespan gap due to more consistent reporting and societal acceptance in recent decades.

📌 Conclusion:
The project revealed how historical social attitudes towards left-handedness impacted recorded death statistics. While early 1900s saw only 3.5% left-handers, the number climbed to 11.8% by the 1980s. This historical bias explains why older studies showed left-handers dying younger — they were underrepresented in older age groups due to societal suppression, not inherent health differences.

By 2018, the average death age difference had dropped to less than 1 year, highlighting how cultural factors, not biology, shaped earlier data.

📊 Visual Summary:
Left-handedness by Age: Steady drop from 13% at age 10 to 2% at age 80.

Mean Left-Handedness by Birth Year: Rose from ~3.5% in 1906 to 11.8% in 1986.

Average Death Age (1990): Left-handers lived 5.2 years less.

Average Death Age (2018): Gap reduced to 0.9 years.
